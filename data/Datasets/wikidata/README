= Dataset =

Based on the dump wikidata-20170627-truthy-BETA.nt.

From this set we extracted every facts about entities having the <P106>:"occupation"
attribute. We also extracted every facts for <P279>:"subClassOf" attributes.

Considering <P106> as a type relation we recomputed the transitive closures of types.

= Cleaning =

We noticed the Wikidata taxonomy is not a directed acyclic graph. We ran a Strongly
Connected Components algorithm to detect cycles and we merged the cycles found.
Thus, classes named <RQ[number]> represent all classes found in the cycle containing
the class <Q[number]>.
